# Mobile Applications

During the fourth semester of the 'Mobile Applications' course, our primary emphasis was on coding applications for smartphones and different portable gadgets, like Android and iOS. Among a plethora of subjects, we addressed the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, fabricated a respiration timer application, and engineered a calculator application. 

## Breathing App 

The timer for breathing showcases the length of time taken for inhalation and exhalation, represented as a count, together with the terms "inhale/exhale" on a gradually darkening background. It also adjusts itself according to the orientation of the mobile device.

## Calculator

The calculator performs the typical mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, among others.  The application adapts to both Android and iOS platforms. 

## Sieve of Eratosthenes

The application is capable of calculating using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
